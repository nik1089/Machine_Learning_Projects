• DOMAIN: Telecom

• CONTEXT: A telecom company wants to use their historical customer data and leverage machine learning to predict behaviour in an attempt 
to retain customers. The end goal is to develop focused customer retention programs

• DATA DESCRIPTION: Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata. The 
data set includes information about:

• Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

• Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and 
streaming TV and movies

• Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

• Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: The objective, as a data scientist hired by the telecom company, is to build a model that will help to identify the 
potential customers who have a higher probability to churn. This will help the company to understand the pain points and patterns of customer 
churn and will increase the focus on strategising customer retention
